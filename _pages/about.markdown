Hi, I’m Maxfield Wikoff-Witten — a software engineer focused on automation, scalable architecture, and clean design. I currently work as a **Risk Rules Engineer at eBay**, where I develop rule-based logic and production-ready code for secure, efficient decision-making.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and styled using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), customized to showcase my work, skills, and career journey.
